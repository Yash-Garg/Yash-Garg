Hello, I'm Yash, a 21-year-old Software Engineer with a keen focus on mobile side of things, working at [Dyte](https://dyte.io) mostly on [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/).

I try to actively contribute to open-source projects, and everything I create for personal use is openly available. My preferred frameworks are [Android](https://developer.android.com/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), which I extensively leverage, reflecting in numerous projects I engage in.

Recently, I've been dedicating my free time to exploring [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and delving into the intricacies of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

You can access my up-to-date [resume](https://yashgarg.dev/resume.pdf) anytime on my [website](https://yashgarg.dev). Additionally, I maintain a [blog](https://yashgarg.dev/blog) where I share insights on topics that pique my interest. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about anything. I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities.
