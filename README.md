### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yash, a 21 year old Software Engineer, currently working at [Dyte](https://dyte.io).

[![Google DevLibrary](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20DevLibrary-Yash%20Garg-brightgreen?style=flat&logo=android)](https://yashgarg.dev/devlibrary) ![Stalkers](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Yash-Garg&color=blueviolet)

I frequently contribute to Open Source, and everything I build for myself is out in the open. I've been extensively using [Android](https://developer.android.com/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) as my framework of choice, so you might find me making a lot of projects with it involved.

Recently, I've been exploring and learning more about [Unix Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

My [resume](https://yashgarg.dev/resume.pdf) is always available on my [website](https://yashgarg.dev), where there are also links to all of my social media accounts. I maintain a [blog](https://yashgarg.dev/blog) where I occasionally share things that I have found interesting. Feel free to reach out to me there or via email if you have any questions about my work!
