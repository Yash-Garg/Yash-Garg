I frequently contribute to Open Source, and everything I build for myself is out in the open. I've been extensively using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) as my framework of choice, so you might find me making a lot of projects with it involved.

Recently, I've been exploring and learning more about [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

For more details you can find the latest version of [my resume here](https://yashgarg.dev/resume.pdf).
